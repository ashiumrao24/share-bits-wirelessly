# share-bits-wirelessly
Innovative file-sharing solution that allows seamless transfer of files between computers and mobile devices without the need for a common network or internet connection.

Here is my simple solution for sharing really small files.
Share small files from an offline source using only a QR code!

Why?

Imagine: You want to share a file with a friend nearby. You want to share from a source that does not have internet access - you just want to beam the file directly to your friend. This system lets you embed your file into a QR code that loads as an actual file download on your friend's device. Try it out here if you're feeling brave! The image that is downloaded by scanning this QR code is not hosted on any server, it only lives inside the QR code.
