### Here is my simple solution for sharing really small files.

Share small files from an offline source using only a QR code!

## Why?

Imagine: You want to share a file with a friend nearby. You want to share from a source that does not have internet access - you just want to beam the file directly to your friend. This system lets you embed your file into a QR code that loads as an actual file download on your friend's device. Try it out here if you're feeling brave! The image that is downloaded by scanning this QR code is not hosted on any server, it only lives inside the QR code.

## How it works
1. Generate a QR Code
Embed a small file into a QR code.
use the web app 
2. Share and Scan
Show the generated QR code to the recipient.
They scan it using any standard QR code scanner capable of handling embedded data (e.g., a smartphone camera or QR reader app).
The file downloads directly to their device.
